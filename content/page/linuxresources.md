### Linux Resources

The radiology servers are running a Linux distribution called Red Hat Enterprise Linux (current version is 7) and therefore it is highly recommended to get familiar with Linux. 

*Note: Keep in mind that the servers run tcsh by default, which is very similar to bash with some slight differences. You can type `bash` into any terminal to start using bash.*
